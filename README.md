India Tourism Revenue and Interest Analysis Dashboard

Project Overview:
This project presents a comprehensive Tourism Revenue and Interest Analysis Dashboard for India, capturing tourism dynamics from 2015 to 2024. It integrates diverse data types including tourism revenue, visitor counts (domestic and international), and detailed segment revenues such as cultural, pilgrimage, heritage, nature, beaches, adventure, and medical tourism.

The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights through interactive visuals and geospatial mapping, enabling stakeholders to understand tourism trends, revenue distribution, and visitor behavior across Indian states and regions.

Problem Statement:

Tourism is a major contributor to India’s economy approximately 5.9% GDP contribution is providing from tourism to india, providing revenue and employment across diverse states and Union Territories. However, due to the vast geographical spread, varying visitor preferences, and multiple categories of tourism such as cultural, pilgrimage, heritage, nature, beaches, adventure, and medical, it becomes challenging to identify which states and categories drive the most value.

Policymakers, planners, and businesses often lack a consolidated, interactive, and visual representation of tourism data to make data-driven decisions. Without such insights, opportunities for focused investment, targeted marketing, and strategic development in tourism remain underutilized.

This project aims to analyze and visualize tourism revenue, visitor data, and category-wise contributions across all 36 states and Union Territories of India from 2015 to 2024. By leveraging Excel for preprocessing and Power BI for dashboard creation, the solution will highlight trends, top-performing states, domestic vs international visitor flow, and category-specific revenue distribution. The final outcome will be a dynamic dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore tourism performance interactively and make informed decisions for sustainable growth.

Tasks Done in Excel
Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates & blanks.

Standardized column names (e.g., "Domestic Visitors", "Revenue (₹ Crores)").

Fixed inconsistent percentage values for tourism categories.

Derived Columns

Total Visitors = Domestic Visitors + International Visitors

Category-wise Revenues = Total Revenue × Category %

Example (for Cultural Revenue):
=[[Tourism Revenue]] * ([[Cultural (%)]] / 100)
Repeated for Pilgrimage, Heritage, Nature, Beaches, Adventure, and Medical.


Data Validation

Ensured category percentages per row ≈ 100%.
